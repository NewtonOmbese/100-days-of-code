**Today's Progress**: Worked on forms and form validations

**Thoughts**: I really needed to get to know how to work and create forms and how to validate them with HTML. I was able to do that through [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-forms-by-building-a-registration-form/step-1)

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
